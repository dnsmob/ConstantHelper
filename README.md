# ConstantHelper

A simple Swift extension that allows different constraint sizes for the same traits but on different screen sizes. It has been ~shamelessly ripped off~ heavily inspired by Layout-Helper [https://github.com/tryWabbit/Layout-Helper]

### Install
Add `ConstantHelper` to your podspec. On the project folder, run `pod install`.

### How to use it
Select a constraint you wish to change. Add values into XCode's *attribute inspector* panel.
